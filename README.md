Chapter 1(Ascent beyond the Stars):
Cruising through the night stars,
Like a calm sea, distance stars warp the undisturbed starship.
Much like a ripple, a comet grazes past our grain-sized planet, nothing more than a twinkle in the sky, whilst a teal hue engulfs the field of view of starship.

BOOM!  Space violently rips.
BAM! An unholy sound echoes through the void.
CRASH! An enormous eerie crystal artifact smashing into the engine of the spacecraft, swing your ship back to earth.
Ready, Set, venture!
Through the void we, ascent beyond the stars.
Where there only promise is of no return.
