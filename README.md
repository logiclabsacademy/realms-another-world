Realms  – Another WORLD

Blurb: In the year 2035, a catastrophe has happened, Spacetime rip has shattered the fabric of reality. 
A team of elite scientist-engineers and brave astronaut adventurers must embark on a perilous mission into the unknown, where no mortal has ventured before. Journey into the void—a realm of untold mysteries and cosmic anomalies. 
Your mission: to navigate through treacherous dimensions, solve intricate coding puzzles, and restore balance to the universe.
 Are you ready to code your way through the cosmos and become a hero in the darkest depths of space?

Chapter 1(Ascent through the Stars):
Cruising through the night stars,
Like a calm sea, distance stars warp the undisturbed Cosmos.
Much like a ripple, a comet grazes past our grain-sized planet, nothing more than a twinkle in the sky, with a teal hue engulfed the view of the starships.

BOOM! BAM! BANG!  
Complete the poem above using the blurbs available in the README.md file.
